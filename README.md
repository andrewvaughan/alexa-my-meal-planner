# My Meal Planner Alexa Skill

The [My Meal Planner][project-url] Alexa Skill allows individuals to plan their meals for the week.  Currently, the
skill returns hard-coded meals depending on the day of the week, but will be enhanced in later versions to
fully-support customized meal options.

## Installation

This skill has not yet been published to the Alexa marketplace.  Instructions will be placed here when this Skill is
made available.

## Usage

Commands will be added here as they are added to the skill.  As of right now, no commands are supported.
